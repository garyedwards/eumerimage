= EUMERimage

EUMERimage is a bash script which downloads the latest imagery from the
https://www.eumetsat.int/website/home/index.html[European Organisation for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellite]
and sets it as the desktop background in https://www.gnome.org/[Gnome].

== Usage

[source:bash]
----
$ eumerimage -h
Usage: eumerimage [OPTION...]
Download the latest image from the European Organisation for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellite and set it as the desktop background.

Options:
    -o      output the filename of the image but do not set it as the background
    -v      verbose output
    -h      display usage
----

image::example.jpg[example image]

== Systemd

An example systemd service and timer are provided in the `systemd/` directory.

NOTE: You only need to set the background path in Gnome once and it will update when that file changes.
As such using the `-o` option works well after a first run.

== Inspiration

This script heavily references Peter Hogg's https://github.com/pigmonkey/goesimage[goesimage] script.
